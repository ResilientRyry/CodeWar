// Story
// Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, 
// this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. 
// Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

// Task
// Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.
