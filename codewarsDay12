function sortByLength (array) {
  // Return an array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest
  return array.sort((a, b) => a.length - b.length);
};



// Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and 
// returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

// For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

// Your function would return the following array:

["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

// All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, 
// so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.
